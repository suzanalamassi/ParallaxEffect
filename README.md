# Overview

Welcome to the Parallax Effect project, a SwiftUI-based application that showcases a unique parallax effect on a collection of travel cards. The main feature of this project is the `ParrallaxSlider` app, which displays a horizontal scrolling collection of travel cards, each with a parallax effect and overlay information. 


## Technologies and Frameworks

This project is built using the following technologies and frameworks:

- **SwiftUI**: The project is built entirely using SwiftUI, Apple's innovative and simple way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift.
- **Xcode**: The project was developed using Xcode, Apple's integrated development environment (IDE) for macOS.
- **XML**: The project includes XML files that contain information about the workspace and the scheme.
- **Property List (plist)**: The project includes plist files that contain key-value pairs of information.

# Installation

Follow these steps to install and start working with the ParallaxEffect project:

1. **Clone the GitHub repository**

   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/ParallaxEffect.git
   ```

   Replace `username` with the actual username of the repository owner.

2. **Install Xcode**

6. **Explore the project**

   The main files of interest are `ParrallaxSliderApp.swift`, `ContentView.swift`, `TravelCard.swift`, `DetailView.swift`, `SliderView.swift`, and `MiniSlider.swift`. These files contain the main logic and UI for the app.

7. **Images**

   The project uses images in three different scales: 1x, 2x, and 3x. These images are included in the `Contents.json` files.

8. **Additional files**

   The project also includes several `.plist` and `.xcworkspacedata` files. These are used by Xcode for project configuration and workspace management.

Please note that this project is written in Swift and requires an Apple computer or device to run.
